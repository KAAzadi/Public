Hello, this is my final project for my Introduction to Problem Solving Using Python course. 
It is written in C# and, to the best of my knowledge, implements the facade design pattern.
This is my first attempt using this design pattern, and I will be constantly revisiting this
code if I find anything that needs refactoring/improving. In addition, I have many other
implementations to this program I hope to add in the future, such as showing the change in 24h
volume. This program as a whole was fairly outside of my comfort zone, as I had not used the
HTTPClient class, the NewtonSoft Json parser, or E-mail messaging before in a program. That
being said, I highly recommend all of them after learning them, as they are all very powerful
assets.
