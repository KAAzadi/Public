This is where I hold my utilities written in C. This includes a tool that was originally created for school, but I added more to fit the way I envisioned it working.
tuls is a linux command that works similarly to the ls command in linux. It's most notable difference is it lists all files within the directory vertically, rather than horizontally.
tucp is a linux command that works similarly to the cp command in linux. It is able to copy a single file to a location/new file name, or multiple files to a new location.
